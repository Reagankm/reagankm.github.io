            <h2>Services</h2>
            <p>Aces Four Construction will bring their experience, hard work, and expertise to bear for you with a variety of sewer and drainage services.  Use the menu at the left or just scroll down the page for more information about our services.</p>
              <p>There are a variety of issues that result in a slow draining sewer or sewer back-up. Some of the most common issues are tree roots, oil/grease in the line, or a broken pipe. These create sewer blockages, causing the pipe to drain slowly or even causing the sewage to back up into your house. Before the pipe is completely blocked, you may notice that your sewer pipes are draining slowly or that your toilet is making a 'gurgling' noise. Should you encounter these warning signs, give Aces Four a call. Often the sewer rooter will be able to clear the issue before a messy and costly backup happens. </p>

            <h2>Video Inspection</h2>
            <p>
              One often-overlooked area for new home buyers is the state of their prospective property's sewers.  Before signing the final paperwork, call Aces Four to come out and do a video inspection.  This can help you feel more confident in your home purchase, avoid any nasty surprises later, and may help you resolve any issues before your purchase or help lower the cost of the final sale.</p>
            <p>
            Video inspection and radio locating of sewer and drainage pipes is also a very useful tool in our arsenal. Aces Four Construction can send a self-leveling color video camera down the pipe, allowing us to see exactly what is going on under the ground. We will provide you with a DVD copy for your records, as well as a written report of our findings. Our technician will also explain everything as it is happening and answer your questions. TV video inspection allows us to see the actual condition of the pipe, provides precise locate marks for any necessary excavation and repair, and provides insight into which trenchless methods of repair/replacement are applicable.</p>

            <h2>Trenchless Sewer Replacement</h2>
            <p>
              There are a variety of "trenchless sewer replacement technologies" available to repair broken sewer and drain pipe, and some of these techniques can even be used for new installation. Aces Four will assess the condition of your pipe and discuss which method will best serve your family and your property. If you are looking to preserve driveways, patios, walkways, or landscaping, you should definitely check out trenchless sewer replacement. Seattle is well suited to these techniques. </p>
              <span class="subanchor" id="pipe-bursting"></span>
              <h3>Pipe Bursting</h3>
            <p>Aces Four was one of the very first sewer contractors in the greater Seattle area to utilize this new technology. Our crews have an unparalleled level of expertise in trenchless pipe replacement. Seattle terrain is perfect for pipe bursting which only requires two excavations. One hole is at the start of the run and one at the end. A concrete bullet/mole is pulled through the old pipe, crushing it, and laying new HDPE pipe behind it. Because pipe bursting allows for the preservation of concrete, asphalt and landscaping, it can be more cost effective than traditional open excavation, since it can eliminate the need for concrete and asphalt removal and replacement. Remember that, depending on the work required, you may need a company like Aces Four Construction, that is registered for work on side sewer in Seattle.</p> 
            <span class="subanchor" id="pipe-lining"></span>
            <h3>Pipe Lining</h3>
            <p>Pipe lining can be a great solution when the break is located under a city street, as city backfill and restoration charges can be an extremely costly addition to your repair invoice. The pipe lining method often only requires one excavation (at the start of the run). A high tech polymer liner is installed into the existing pipe. It molds itself to the walls of your pipe, plugging holes and blocking future root intrusion. The perma-liner will cure in a few hours and provides essentially a "new pipe" insert in your existing pipe.</p> 
            <span class="subanchor" id="horizontal-drilling"></span>
            <h3>Horizontal Drilling</h3>
            <p>Also referred to as Directional Boring, this trenchless pipe method can be used for installation of new sewer, drainage, and water line pipe, or for re-routing existing pipes. Only requiring two excavations (one at the start of the run and one at the end), horizontal drilling lays new pipe in a straight line between the two excavations. Directional boring can save time and money, as well as protecting existing concrete and asphalt and preserving landscape.</p>
            <h3>The Right Solution for Trenchless Sewer Replacement</h3>
            <p>Aces Four Construction is dedicated to selecting the best trenchless sewer replacement solution for your specific situation. We are skilled at all the techniques for trenchless sewer replacement. The Greater Seattle Area can count on Aces Four Construction. <a href="contact-us.html">Call now for a free estimate.</a></p>

            <h2>Drainage and Storm Solutions</h2>
            <p>Aces Four Construction are experts at drainage solutions for your residence, as well as for new construction projects. From catch basins to large detention systems, we will create a drainage system to handle your storm water issues and protect your property. We are adept at storm detention systems, retention ponds, rain gardens and bio cells. The Aces Four family is expert at large scale storm water systems and new construction drainage detention, as well as small residential drainage issues. With over 40 years experience in our wonderful rainy pacific northwest weather, we'll help with all your property's drainage needs. </p>
            <h3>Yard Drainage</h3>
            <p>Yard drainage can be a problem. Not only is it frustrating to have a soggy lawn (depriving your family of using this mucky grass), but it can cause damage to your lawn/landscaping, damaging plants and causing moss invasion. Paved areas such as patios and walkways can crack, settle, become covered in moss, and become icy/dangerous in cold temperatures. Each yard is unique, so Aces Four will come out to your property to properly assess your conditions and how best to resolve your drainage problems. </p>
            <p>Similarly, driveway drainage issues can be a headache, creating mossy surfaces that can settle and crack. Also, water can create large pools/puddles, often seeping into a nearby garage. We'll assess your driveway drain situation, and propose the appropriate solution, which often includes a trench drain or catch basin. </p>
            <h3>Water in Your Basement or Crawl Space?</h3>
            <p> If water is getting into your basement or crawlspace, a problem which can occur when current footing drain or downspout systems fail or when groundwater conditions around your property have changed, this can be quite damaging. It not only affects your carpet/flooring, but also presents dangers of mold, humidity, and structural damage to your home.</p>
            <p>Our estimator will meet you at your property to inspect the drainage situation, discuss options, and provide an estimate for how best to protect your house.</p>
            <p>Often the best solution is an exterior footing drain system (i.e. repairing an existing system or installing a new foundation drain system). Aces Four can excavate to expose your foundation and install footing drains (perforated pipe surrounded in washed rock) to collect the ground water and move it away from your house. We seal coat the exposed portion of the foundation wall to prevent further water infiltration. </p>
            <h3>Clogged Downspouts?</h3>
            <p>Your drainage problems may also be caused by your downspout lines. If there are blocked drain lines, we can use our rooter machine or hydro jetter to help clear the line. If downspout repair is needed, we also have the expertise to perform this drainage repair. We will design a yard drainage system that will best protect your property and provide the best value to you. Often it is advantageous to connect a downspout system to a catch basin, infiltrator, or bubble box farther away from your home. </p>

            <h2>Environmentally Friendly Drainage Solutions</h2>
            <p>Drainage systems can include green technology such as rain gardens, new advances in bioretention cells which help remove contaminants from water runoff before it enters the storm system.</p>
            <h3>Rain Gardens</h3>
            <p>Rain gardens, also called bioretention cells, are planted depressions designed to allow storm water to absorb back into the ground rather than flow into storm drains.  They have been shown to significantly reduce the amount of pollution reaching local waterways and because they're so effective at capturing water they can also help to reduce flooding.  Because of their many benefits some local governments in the Puget Sound area have incentive programs for installing a rain garden on your property.  To see if you qualify, check out the programs listed at the <a href="http://www.12000raingardens.org/about-rain-gardens/incentives/">12,000 Rain Gardens Incentives page</a>.</p>
